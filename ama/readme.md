# FTA Live:  Ask me anything on End-of-Life migrations

We invite you to join us for this session where you can ask questions on best practices and guidance for migrating services approaching end-of-life such as Logic Apps ISE, ASE v1 and v2, and APIM stv1. Whether you are facing challenges or seeking advice on how to smoothly transition these services, our expert will be there to share their knowledge, insights and help unblock you on your migration activities.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop an understanding of the potential impact and risks associated with migrating these services.
